Credit card fraud detection using ML

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions. The model utilizes various features associated with each transaction to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. 


Project Description

In this project, we analyze credit card transaction data to build a Machine Learning model that can identify potentially fradulent transactions. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training and evaluation.
